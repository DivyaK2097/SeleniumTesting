# Selenium WebDriver Test Cases for "The Internet" Application
This repository contains Selenium WebDriver-based test cases for automating interactions with the The Internet web application (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/). The test cases are written in Java and utilize Selenium WebDriver to simulate user actions on various pages of the application.

Test Scenarios Covered:
The test cases in this repository demonstrate how to automate and validate various user interactions on The Internet application. The following scenarios are covered:

Verifying how the page updates dynamically, and automating interaction with dynamic content that loads after clicking.

- Checkboxes and Radio Buttons:
Interacting with checkboxes and radio buttons, checking/unchecking, and verifying their states.

- File Upload:
Automating file upload operations to simulate users uploading files via the web application.

Technologies Used:
- Java: Programming language used for test scripting.
- Selenium WebDriver: Web automation tool to simulate user interactions.
